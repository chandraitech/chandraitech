# Hi there, [Chandra Permanasari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandra-permanasari-b62a4b1bb/?originalSubdomain=id) 👋
## Profile:
I am a Bachelor of Psychology graduate in 2022, with experience working for 6 months at PT. Kimia Farma, Tbk. as the Assessment Center unit and worked as HR Recruitment for almost 6 months at PT. Gistex. I have good English skills, able to do simple language conversation for daily activities. In my previous position, I was responsible for facilitating an Assessment of 1,000 employees from every entity in every branch in Indonesia, while in my current position I can fulfill every employee request with the fastest time of 1 week.

Currently I am interested in a career in a mining company, because I want to hone my mentality so that I can be even better and take advantage of youth to explore places I have not visited. In addition, the position currently being applied for is compatible with My previous job, so I have a tendency to adapt more quickly to every job task and the company's work environment. In the next three years I have a goal to work in a field that is relevant to my educational background and try to stay in that job with the aim of honing my competence and mentality in a new environment.
